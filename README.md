Pixel Art Maker
Task
You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

Key Takeaways
Accessing DOM elements using the `document` object methods
Define functions and append them to DOM elements as event listeners
Code nested loops to delete and create a table based on user input
